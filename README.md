DESCRIPTION:

The three html files make up a simple website created with Bootstrap elements that will showcase my future coding projects. They share common features (navigation bar, footer) but have the following unique elements:

index.html:
- Picture of myself
- Bio paragraphs
- Card containing links to professional accounts

portfolio.html:
- Card containing placeholder images for future projects

contact.html:
- form with fields for name, email, and message, with a "submit" button (currently non-functioning)
