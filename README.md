DESCRIPTION:

The three html files make up a simple website created with Bootstrap elements that will showcase my current coding projects. They share common features (navigation bar, footer) but have the following unique elements:

index.html:
- Picture of myself
- Bio paragraphs
- Card containing links to resume and professional accounts
- Card containing contact information

portfolio.html:
- Card containing project thumbnails, linking to projects hosted on Github

![See Assets folder](Assets/portfolio.png?raw=true)

contact.html:
- form with fields for name, email, and message, with a "submit" button (currently non-functioning)
